# Dotfiles for Laptop

This repo contains my dotfiles for my laptop. The purpose of having a separate repo for my laptop is to fulfill different needs. My laptop has only a single, small screen, so I found a status bar at the top of the screen unnecessary. I also have adjusted the mouse settings to work better with a trackpad. Small things like this made it seem necessary to have a repo dedicated to laptop dotfiles.
